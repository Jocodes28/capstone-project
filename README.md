# Welcome to our Rick and Morty Site!

Vist us at [Our Site](https://rick-and-morty-react-capstone.herokuapp.com/)

Created by Joyce Young, Johanny Clase, and Daniel de la Huerta

## Here's what our page is about:

While looking through a million and one APIs, we came across this particular API listing every character from Rick and Morty with plenty of details to work with [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).\
Our group built a modern Single-Page Application(SPA) that organizes the information given by the API to make searching for characters, and their info, much easier.\
The SPA utilizes [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a scaffolding and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to connect our components into a single page.
